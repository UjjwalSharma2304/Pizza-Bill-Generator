PIZZA BILL GENERATOR

This project is a straightforward, interactive Python application that simulates a pizza ordering kiosk. I built this to demonstrate how to handle user inputs, manage data with dictionaries, and generate clean, formatted output in a command-line environment.



## **Key Features**



* Interactive Menu: Clearly displays sizes and toppings with up-to-date prices in Indian Rupees.



* Smart Input Handling: The program is case-insensitive (accepts "Small", "small", or "SMALL") and won't crash if you make a typo.



* Dynamic Billing: Watch your total update in real-time as you add toppings.



* Itemized Receipt: Generates a professional summary at the end, breaking down the base cost and individual toppings.



## **How It Works**



* Dictionaries: Used to store menu data (sizes and toppings), making it incredibly easy to update prices without rewriting code.



* While Loops: Ensures the program keeps asking for toppings until the customer is truly "done."



* F-Strings: Heavily used to ensure the currency formatting (e.g., ₹199.00) looks clean and aligned.



## **Getting Started**

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x 



## **Installation \& Run**

1. Clone or Download this repository.
   
2. Open your terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
   
3. Run the script:

&nbsp;  python code.py



## **Future Improvements**

If I continue working on this, here are a few things I'd like to add:



* &nbsp;Delivery Options: Add a delivery fee or takeaway discount.



* &nbsp;Multiple Pizzas: Allow ordering more than one pizza in a single session.



* &nbsp;Save to File: Export the final receipt to a .txt file.
